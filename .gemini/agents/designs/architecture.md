# System Architecture: User Registration Service

This document outlines the technical architecture for the secure user registration service.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components:

1.  **Registration API:** A stateless RESTful API service that handles all business logic for user registration, verification, and authentication.
2.  **Database:** A relational database to persist user account information.
3.  **Email Service:** A third-party transactional email service to send verification emails.

## 2. Data Flow

### Registration Flow
1.  **User** sends a `POST` request with email and password to the **Registration API**.
2.  The **API** validates the input and checks if the user already exists in the **Database**.
3.  The **API** hashes the password and stores the new user record in the **Database** with a `pending` status.
4.  The **API** generates a unique, short-lived verification token.
5.  The **API** calls the **Email Service** to send a verification email to the user, including the token.
6.  The **User** clicks the link in the email, sending a `GET` request to the **API** with the token.
7.  The **API** validates the token, activates the user's account in the **Database** (sets status to `active`), and returns a success response.

## 3. Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **API Service** | **Node.js w/ Express.js** | Fast, non-blocking I/O is well-suited for an I/O-bound service. The large NPM ecosystem provides robust libraries for security (bcrypt, JWT), data validation, and database access. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** | A reliable, feature-rich relational database that can enforce data integrity (e.g., UNIQUE constraint on email). It is highly scalable and has strong community support. |
| **Email Service** | **Third-Party (e.g., AWS SES, SendGrid)** | Offloads the complexity of email deliverability, reputation management, and scaling. Provides reliable and trackable email sending. |
| **Deployment** | **Docker / AWS Fargate** | Containerizing the application with Docker ensures consistency across environments. Deploying on a serverless container platform like AWS Fargate allows for easy scaling and management without provisioning servers. |

## 4. Security Architecture

- **Authentication:** Future-facing authentication for protected endpoints will be handled via **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**. The login endpoint (to be designed) will issue short-lived access tokens.
- **Authorization:** A simple Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model will be used, starting with a `user` role. This can be extended as the application grows.
- **Secret Management:** Application secrets (database credentials, JWT secret, email service API keys) will be managed via environment variables, injected securely at runtime by the hosting platform (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler).
- **Encryption:**
    - **In Transit:** All API endpoints will be protected with **TLS 1.2 or higher**.
    - **At Rest:** Database-level encryption will be enabled for the PostgreSQL instance.
- **Input Validation:** A middleware-based approach using a library like `express-validator` will be used to validate all incoming request bodies and parameters against a strict schema.
- **Security Headers:** The API will return standard security headers (e.g., `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) will be configured to only allow requests from known and trusted frontend domains.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The P95 latency for the registration and verification endpoints should be **< 500ms**. The service will use database connection pooling to minimize latency.
- **Scalability:** The API will be designed as a **stateless service**. This allows for horizontal scaling by simply adding more container instances behind a load balancer.
- **Reliability:** The service will be deployed across multiple availability zones (AZs) for high availability, targeting **99.9% uptime**. Health check endpoints will be exposed for monitoring.
- **Observability:**
    - **Logging:** Structured JSON logs will be emitted for all requests, errors, and key business events (e.g., user registered, user verified).
    - **Monitoring:** Key metrics (request rate, error rate, latency) will be exposed and collected by a monitoring service like Prometheus or AWS CloudWatch.
    - **Tracing:** Distributed tracing can be added later to trace requests across services.
