# Secure User Registration System Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Project Description
This project will create a secure user registration system. New users will be able to create an account using their email address and a password. The system will enforce password strength requirements, verify the user's email address before activating the account, and include security measures like rate limiting to prevent abuse.

### 1.2. Business Objectives
- **Enhance Security:** Protect the platform and its users by ensuring only legitimate, verified users can gain access.
- **Improve User Trust:** Provide a professional and secure onboarding experience for new users.
- **Enable User-Specific Features:** Lay the foundation for personalized user experiences and features that require authentication.
- **Reduce Spam/Bot Accounts:** Minimize the creation of fake or automated accounts through email verification and rate limiting.

### 1.3. Success Metrics
- High rate of successful user registrations and email verifications.
- Low number of support tickets related to account creation issues.
- Zero security incidents related to compromised registration flow.
- Audit logs successfully capture all registration events.

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1. Primary User Story: New User Registration
**USER STORY:**
As a new visitor
I want to register for an account with my email and a secure password
So that I can access the platform's features.

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**
- A user can access a registration page with fields for email and password.
- The system validates that the provided email address is in a valid format.
- The system checks if the email address is already registered. If so, it informs the user with a clear message and suggests logging in.
- The password must meet defined complexity and length requirements, and the requirements are clearly displayed to the user.
- Upon successful submission, the user's account is created in an "inactive" or "pending verification" state.
- The system sends a verification email to the user's provided email address.
- The user is shown a page informing them to check their email to complete the registration.
- All registration attempts (successful and failed) are logged for security auditing.

### 2.2. Related User Story: Email Verification
**USER STORY:**
As a newly registered user
I want to verify my email address by clicking a link in the verification email
So that my account becomes active and I can log in.

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:**
- The verification email contains a unique, time-sensitive link.
- When the user clicks the verification link, the system validates the token.
- Upon successful validation, the user's account is marked as "active."
- The user is redirected to a confirmation page or directly to the login page.
- If the link is invalid or expired, the user is shown an error message with an option to resend the verification email.

### 2.3. Edge Cases
- A user tries to register with an email address that has a pending verification.
- A user requests to resend the verification email multiple times.
- The verification token is tampered with.
- The registration form is submitted with empty fields.

## 3. Security Requirements

### 3.1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Storage:** Passwords must **never** be stored in plaintext. They must be hashed using a strong, modern, salted hashing algorithm (e.g., **bcrypt** or **Argon2**).
- **Email Verification:** User accounts must remain inactive and inaccessible until the email address is verified. This prevents users from signing up with emails they don't own.
- **Password Strength:** Enforce minimum password complexity:
    - Minimum 12 characters.
    - Must include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

### 3.2. Data Protection
- **Data in Transit:** All communication between the client and server must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.
- **Data at Rest:** Sensitive user data should be encrypted at rest in the database.
- **Verification Tokens:** Email verification tokens must be securely generated, unique, and time-limited.

### 3.3. Abuse Prevention
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the registration endpoint (per IP address) to protect against brute-force attacks and bot registrations.
- **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user-provided input (email, password) to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQLi).

### 3.4. Compliance
- **GDPR:** The registration process must include obtaining explicit consent from the user for data processing, with a link to the Privacy Policy. Users should be informed about how their data will be used.

### 3.5. Audit Logging
- Log all successful registration attempts, including user ID, email, and timestamp.
- Log all failed registration attempts, including the reason for failure (e.g., email already exists, invalid input) and the source IP address.
- Log all email verification events (sent, clicked, expired).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
    - API response time for the registration endpoint should be under 500ms.
    - Email verification messages should be sent within 60 seconds of registration.
- **Scalability:** The registration system should be able to handle a significant increase in user sign-ups without performance degradation.
- **Reliability:** The registration service should have high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).

## 5. Definition of Done

- All acceptance criteria for the user stories are met.
- All security requirements are implemented and have been reviewed by a security champion.
- Unit and integration tests are written, achieving >80% code coverage for the registration logic.
- All code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- API documentation for the registration endpoint is created or updated.
- The feature is deployed to a staging environment and has passed QA testing.
- Audit logs are confirmed to be generating correctly.

## 6. Open Questions

- What is the exact expiration time for email verification links (e.g., 24 hours)?
- Which third-party service will be used for sending emails?
- What are the specific rate-limiting thresholds (e.g., 10 registration attempts per hour per IP)?
- Are there any other compliance frameworks besides GDPR that need to be considered (e.g., CCPA)?
- How should the system handle disposable email addresses? Should they be blocked?
