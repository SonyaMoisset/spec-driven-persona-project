## FEATURE TO THREAT MODEL
{{args}}

## EXISTING DESIGN
Review any existing design documents:
```sh
if [ -f .gemini/agents/designs/architecture.md ]; then cat .gemini/agents/designs/architecture.md; else echo "No architecture document found. Proceeding with threat modeling based on description."; fi
```

## STRIDE THREAT MODELING

Analyze the feature systematically using STRIDE:

### **S - SPOOFING IDENTITY**
**Threat:** Can an attacker impersonate a legitimate user or system component?

**Attack Scenarios:**
- [List specific spoofing attack scenarios for this feature]

**Assets at Risk:**
- [What could be compromised]

**Mitigations:**
- [Specific controls to prevent spoofing]
- Authentication mechanisms
- Identity verification
- Multi-factor authentication considerations

---

### **T - TAMPERING WITH DATA**
**Threat:** Can an attacker modify data in transit or at rest?

**Attack Scenarios:**
- [List specific tampering scenarios]

**Assets at Risk:**
- [Data that could be modified]

**Mitigations:**
- [Specific controls to prevent tampering]
- Input validation
- HTTPS/TLS
- Data integrity checks
- Database constraints

---

### **R - REPUDIATION**
**Threat:** Can users deny performing actions?

**Attack Scenarios:**
- [List scenarios where repudiation is possible]

**Assets at Risk:**
- [What actions need non-repudiation]

**Mitigations:**
- [Specific controls for non-repudiation]
- Audit logging
- Transaction logs
- Digital signatures
- Event tracking

---

### **I - INFORMATION DISCLOSURE**
**Threat:** Can sensitive information be exposed to unauthorized parties?

**Attack Scenarios:**
- [List information disclosure scenarios]
- Error messages revealing system details
- Unencrypted data in transit
- Inadequate access controls
- Email enumeration

**Assets at Risk:**
- [Sensitive data that could be exposed]

**Mitigations:**
- [Specific controls to prevent disclosure]
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls
- Generic error messages
- Secure logging practices
- Data minimization

---

### **D - DENIAL OF SERVICE**
**Threat:** Can an attacker make the system unavailable?

**Attack Scenarios:**
- [List DoS scenarios]
- Resource exhaustion
- API flooding
- Database connection exhaustion

**Assets at Risk:**
- [What could become unavailable]

**Mitigations:**
- [Specific controls to prevent DoS]
- Rate limiting
- Resource quotas
- Circuit breakers
- Request throttling
- CAPTCHA for public endpoints

---

### **E - ELEVATION OF PRIVILEGE**
**Threat:** Can users gain unauthorized access or permissions?

**Attack Scenarios:**
- [List privilege escalation scenarios]
- Authorization bypass
- SQL injection leading to admin access
- Parameter manipulation

**Assets at Risk:**
- [What elevated privileges could be gained]

**Mitigations:**
- [Specific controls to prevent privilege escalation]
- Principle of least privilege
- Role-based access control
- Authorization checks at every layer
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized queries

---

## SUMMARY
**Risk Level Assessment:**
- High Risk Threats: [List]
- Medium Risk Threats: [List]
- Low Risk Threats: [List]

**Priority Mitigations:**
1. [Most critical mitigation]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

**Recommended Security Controls:**
- [Must-have control 1]
- [Must-have control 2]
- [Should-have control 1]
- [Nice-to-have control 1]

**Next Steps:**
1. Review with Security Champion
2. Validate mitigations with AppSec Engineer
3. Ensure mitigations are included in implementation plan

## OUTPUT
Save the threat model to `.gemini/agents/designs/threat-model.md`

Please conduct the STRIDE threat modeling now.
